run demo_NBSGD_binary_classification for binary classification
run demo_NBSGD_multi_classification for multiclassification
run demo_NBSGD_binary_classification for regresion

% Explanation of some parameters

There are three main parameters.
lambda: for regularization, the default value is  100/N where N is the number of training data points.
sigma: for RBF kernel, defaul 0.1
beta: control the budget maintenance rate, default value is 0.5
