### Description
This is the released source code for Nonparametric Stochastic Gradient Descent.


### Run the code
    run demo_NBSGD_binary_classification for binary classification
    run demo_NBSGD_multi_classification for multiclassification
    run demo_NBSGD_binary_classification for regresion

### Explanation of some parameters

There are three main parameters.
lambda: for regularization. The default value is 100/N where N is the number of training data points.
sigma: for RBF kernel. The defaul value is 0.1
beta: control the budget maintenance rate, ranging from 0 to 1. The default value is 0.5
